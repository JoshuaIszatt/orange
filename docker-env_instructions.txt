## Development

### Update `package-list.txt` and `requirements.txt`

It is normally not necessary to install conda packages one-by-one as per these instructions, but attempting to install them all at once causes conda to get stuck, hence this workaround adds packages one-by-one.

Start from scratch, with no environment active. Remove it if it already exists.

1. Update `environment.yml` and with new conda package requirments. Add any pip packages to `environment.yml` and `requirements.txt`.
2. Inside `environment.yml` comment (#) out all packages execpt for python.
3. Create environment:

    ```sh
    conda env create -f enviroment.yml
    ```

4. Uncomment a package.


5. Update environment:

    ```sh
    conda env update -f environment.yml
    ```

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all packages are installed.
7. Activate environment:

    ```sh
    conda activate genome-assembly
    ```

8. Export conda package list:

    ```sh
    conda list --export --explicit | grep -v @EXPLICIT > package-list.txt
    ```

9. Export pip package list:

    ```sh
    pip freeze | grep -v " @ " > constraints.txt
    ```

10. Check that the dockerfile includes instructions for the docker to build the environment wihtin the container.

11. Build new docker image.
    ```bash
    docker build -t iszatt/orange:0.0.1 .
    ```

11. Test that it works (by running it)
    ```bash
     docker run -v <PATH_TO_RAW_SEQUENCES>:/orange/working iszatt/genome-assembly:<TAG>
    ```

^ This run command will mount the <PATH TO RAW SEQ> into the container directory /orange/working/

12. Push changes to git repo using git commands (git status -> git add --all -> git commit -m 'my commit message' -> git push)
