When working on a document with somebody else at the same time:

1. Login and enter container

Update yoour copy of the repository
2. git fetch
3. git pull

NOTE: You now have the most up to date repository

Create a new branch with you name on it
4. git branch <NAME>

Switch to your branch
5. git switch <MAIN>

Check you are on the correct branch before making changes 
6. git branch --all
(The branch you are on will have a * next to it)

7. Make your changes on your branch and afterwards:
git add --all
git commit -m 'some changes'
git push

8. Whe you have finished making changes and the code is stable, switch back to main
git switch main 

9. Merge your <NAME> branch into the main branch
git merge <NAME>
