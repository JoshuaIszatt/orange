When working on a document with somebody else at the same time:

1. Login and enter container

Update yoour copy of the repository
2. git fetch
3. git pull

NOTE: You now have the most up to date repository

Create a new branch with you name on it
4. git branch <NAME>

Switch to your branch
5. git switch <MAIN>

Check you are on the correct branch before making changes 
6. git branch --all
(The branch you are on will have a * next to it)

7. Make your changes on your branch and afterwards:
git add --all
git commit -m 'some changes'
git push


AT THIS POINT: You can keep working on your branch for ages without care. We only need to move on when we are ready to test out the container with both of our changes / functions.

8. Whe you have finished making changes and the code is stable, switch back to main
git switch main 

9. Merge your <NAME> branch into the main branch and push to remote repository
git merge <NAME>
git push
